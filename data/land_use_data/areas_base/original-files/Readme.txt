Climate mitigation scenarios
REF= Reference
RCP= RCP 2.6

EU Forest Use Scenarios
MFM= Multifunctional Forest Management > forcing of multifunctional forest management models on suitable area
SFM= Set Aside Forest Management > forcing of set aside on suitable area

Forest Management scenarios
noAF= no alternative forest management
AF0= not forcing payments for alternative extensive managements (favouring alternative intensification managements>clearcuts)
AF25 = forcing with payments to 25% expansion of alternative extensive managements (selective, retention) 
AF50 = forcing with payments to 50% expansion of alternative extensive managements (selective, retention) 
AF75 = forcing with payments to 75% expansion of alternative extensive managements (selective, retention) 
AF100 = forcing with payments to 100% expansion of alternative extensive managements (selective, retention) 

File "Region_classification.xlsx" 
Includes the list of EU28 Countries, NUTS2 administrative untis, GLOBIOM Regions and their classification as Boreal, Temperate and Tropical 

File "Land_use_area.xlsx" 
Includes the land use area under the two climate mitigation scenarios, it is assumed not affected by the EU Forest Management Scenarios
Resolution= Ecoregion
Unit= Million ha
Years= 2000-2100 (10 years time steps)
CrpLnd= cropland under production for agricultural products, modeled in GLOBIOM
WetLnd= wetland not modeled in GLOBIOM
NotRel= Not relevant land (deserts, glaciers, etc.)
OagLnd= Other agricultural land not modeled in GLOBIOM (eg. fruit trees)
MngFor= Managed Forest Land, modeled in GLOBIOM
PriFor= Primary Forest and Not managed Forest Land, modeled in GLOBIOM
Ene_Plant= Energy Plantations, modeled in GLOBIOM (in the EU28 these are perennial crops, outside EU these are similar to pulpwood plantations)
GrsLnd= Grassland under production for feeding animals, modeled in GLOBIOM 
NatLnd= Natural Vegetation Land, modeled in GLOBIOM (moslty grass land not used for feeding purposes and natural vegetation)
AfrLnd= Afforested land for climate mitigation, modeled in GLOBIOM (it is kept as a separate category from forests and plantations)

File "Internal_EU28_managed_forest_area.xlsx" 
Includes the evolution of areas of forest area under management in the EU at each time step
Resolution= Ecoregion
Unit= 1000 ha
Years= 2000-2100 (10 years time steps)
Categories of forest managements in the EU:
-Clear_Cut= Clear-cut (temperate and boreal)
-Retention= Retention (temperate and boreal) 
-Selection= Selection systems (temperate and boreal)

File "Internal_EU28_perennial_energy_crops_area.xlsx" 
Includes the evolution of energy crops area (perennials crops cultivated for energy eg. willow) in the EU
Resolution= Ecoregion
Unit= 1000 ha
Years= 2020-2100 (10 years time steps, no perennial energy crops before year 2020)
Categories of land occupied:
CrpLnd=CropLand occupied

Categories in "average" sheet (obtained by asssuming the average forest management area in each Region being traded):
Clear_Cut=Clear-cut (temperate and boreal)
Selection= Selection systems (temperate and boreal)
Selective= Conventional selective logging (tropical)
Plantation= Timber plantations & Plantations for pulp (no distinction made between them > e,g. could be assumed 50% each of them)
Categories in "marginal" sheet (obtained by assuming the most productive forest management area being traded> all trade from clearcuts and plantations)
Clear_Cut=Clear-cut (temperate and boreal)
Plantation= Timber plantations & Plantations for pulp
