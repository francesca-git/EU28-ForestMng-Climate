Results and scripts to test alternative options to calculate the VS (vulnerability scores) for plants. 

Files: 

-*comparison_VS.xlxs* : comparison of various versions of VS (ration between global and regional CFs of the LC-Impact methodology, Chaudhary et al. (2015)[1], Chaudhary & Brooks (2018))[2]. 
-*Ecoregions_description_Chaudhary2015-2018.csv* : VS from Chaudhary et al. (2015)[1] and Chaudhary & Brooks (2018)[2].
-*Ecoregions_description_GEP.csv* : VS have been replaced by the GEP [3], which are not available for plants yet though. 
-*Ecoregions_description_VS-from-ratio-LCImpact.csv* : VS for all species groups have been obtained as ratio between the global and regional CFs of the LC-Impact methodology.
-*Ecoregions_description_VSplants_TL0.5.csv* : VS have been obtained as a ratio between the global and regional CFs of the LC-Impact methodology assuming a threat level of 0.5 for plants.
-*Ecoregions_description_VSplants_TL1.csv* : VS have been obtained as a ratio between the global and regional CFs of the LC-Impact methodology assuming a threat level of 1 for plants.
-*VS_plants_mamm_birds.csv* : VS for plants, mammals and birds obtained from the ration between the global and regional CFs of the LC-Impact methodology using the script *VS_plants-mamm-birds.R*.
-*VS_plants-mamm-birds.R* : script used to produce *VS_plants_mamm_birds.csv*.
