# data/model_parameters/ecoregions_data/z_analysis

This folder contains some plots meant to explore the dataset [1] used to obtain the z values used in the study.

Additionally, it contains 

	- *z_originals_Drakare_2005_SITable1.csv*: table with the aggregated data from the SI of the data source [1].
	- **z_SAR_data_full-table.csv** and *z_SAR_data_full-table.xlsx*: original files sent by Prof. Hillebrand (corresponding 
	author of [1]) with the detailed dataset. The .csv file is used as input for the R code *scripts/data_preparation/z_values.R*.
	- *z_analysis.xlsx*: file with some manual analysis to see how the extinction risk respond to different z values.
